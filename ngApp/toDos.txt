role based authentication:
- either User or Admin role is created during registration
- after successful login, respective role is returned in token / response
- angular stores role info with token
- header menu component displays related menu options as per role info
- when user bypasses header menu options and directly types url then, on server side
api's controller code checks with [Authorize("Admin")] and if un-authorised then,
returns 403 (Forbidden)
- on angular side auth.interceptor.ts file catches 403 and, redirects to home page
else if (err.status == 403){
                            // not authorise
                            // redirect to home page
                            this.router.navigateByUrl('/home');
                        }
